# Collaborative Assessment Protocol

## Quick Reference
- **Group Size**: Small Group (SG, 2-4) or Full Team (FT, 5+)
- **Time Required**: 45-50 minutes
- **Focus Areas**: Teaching Practice, Curriculum, Assessment
- **Data Type**: Qualitative, Observational
- **Structure**: Highly Structured
- **Purpose**: Issue Identification, Generate Solutions
- **Template**: [Download Reflection Template](../templates/collaborative-assessment-template.md)

## Overview
The Collaborative Assessment Protocol provides a structured approach for educators to collectively examine and improve teaching practices, curriculum materials, or assessment tools. It creates a safe space for constructive feedback while maintaining focus on evidence and student learning outcomes.

## Theoretical Background
The protocol draws on several theoretical frameworks:
- Critical Friends Group practices (National School Reform Faculty, 1995)
- Assessment for Learning principles (Black & Wiliam, 2009)
- Professional Learning Communities (DuFour et al., 2006)
- Peer Learning Theory (Topping, 2005)
- Constructive Alignment (Biggs, 2003)

## Materials Needed
- [Collaborative Assessment Template](../templates/collaborative-assessment-template.md)
- Teaching materials/evidence for review
- Timer
- [Feedback Guidelines](../guides/feedback-guidelines.md)
- Documentation tools
- [Observation Framework](../guides/observation-framework.md)

## Detailed Process

### 1. Context Setting (5 mins)
**Focus**: Understanding the Background
**Presenter Guidelines**:
- Explain context briefly
- State specific focus area
- Share relevant background
- Identify key questions

*Research Note: The importance of context in professional learning is supported by Timperley's (2011) research on professional conversations.*

[See Context Setting Guide](../guides/context-setting.md)

### 2. Silent Examination (10 mins)
**Focus**: Individual Review
**Guidelines**:
- Review materials quietly
- Take personal notes
- Consider guiding questions
- Mark specific points for discussion

*Research Note: This quiet reflection phase draws on Sch√∂n's (1983) work on reflective practice and Brookfield's (1995) critical reflection approach.*

### 3. Warm Feedback Round (10 mins)
**Focus**: Strengths and Positives
**Guiding Questions**:
- What's working well?
- What shows promise?
- What aligns with best practice?
- What supports student learning?

*Research Note: The appreciative approach is grounded in Cooperrider's (2005) work on appreciative inquiry in education.*

[See Warm Feedback Guide](../guides/warm-feedback.md)

### 4. Cool Feedback Round (10 mins)
**Focus**: Areas for Growth
**Guiding Questions**:
- What could be enhanced?
- Where might students struggle?
- What alternatives exist?
- What clarification is needed?

*Research Note: The structured feedback approach aligns with Hattie's (2009) research on effective feedback in education.*

[See Cool Feedback Guide](../guides/cool-feedback.md)

### 5. Reflection and Response (10 mins)
**Focus**: Integration and Planning
**Guidelines**:
- Presenter reflects first
- Group discusses insights
- Plan next steps
- Document key points

*Research Note: This reflection phase incorporates elements from Kolb's (1984) experiential learning cycle.*

## Group Implementation
[See Group Process Guide](../guides/group-process.md)

### Roles
- Facilitator
- Presenter
- Timekeeper
- Recorder
- Participants

### Size Adaptations
- Small Groups: More discussion time
- Larger Groups: Use structured turn-taking
- Full Team: Consider breakout groups

## Facilitation Notes
[See Complete Facilitation Guide](../guides/facilitation-tips.md)

### Tips for Success
- Maintain protocol structure
- Focus on evidence
- Balance participation
- Keep time strictly
- Document insights

### Common Pitfalls
- Rushing feedback rounds
- Mixing warm and cool feedback
- Skipping context setting
- Inadequate documentation
- Limited reflection time

## Variations
[See Protocol Variations Guide](../guides/protocol-variations.md)
- Assessment Task Review
- Curriculum Planning Review
