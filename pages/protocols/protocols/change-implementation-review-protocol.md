# Change Implementation Review Protocol

## Quick Reference
- **Group Size**: Full Team (FT)
- **Time Required**: 45-50 minutes
- **Focus Areas**: All Focus Areas
- **Data Type**: Qualitative, Quantitative, Observational
- **Structure**: Highly Structured
- **Purpose**: Track Progress, Issue Identification
- **Template**: [Download Reflection Template](../templates/change-implementation-template.md)

## Overview
The Change Implementation Review Protocol provides a structured approach for teams to systematically evaluate the implementation and impact of educational changes. It supports evidence-based decision making about maintaining, modifying, or discontinuing changes while identifying necessary adjustments and support needs.

## Theoretical Background
The protocol is grounded in several theoretical frameworks:
- Implementation Science (Fixsen et al., 2005)
- Change Management in Education (Fullan, 2007)
- Continuous Improvement Cycle (Langley et al., 2009)
- Organizational Learning (Senge, 2006)
- Diffusion of Innovations (Rogers, 2003)

## Materials Needed
- [Change Implementation Template](../templates/change-implementation-template.md)
- Original change documentation
- Implementation timeline
- Evidence/data collected
- [Change Documentation Guide](../guides/change-documentation.md)
- [Evidence Collection Framework](../guides/evidence-collection-framework.md)

## Detailed Process

### 1. Review Original Goals (5 mins)
**Focus**: Establishing Baseline
**Guidelines**:
- Review initial objectives
- Confirm success criteria
- Examine implementation timeline
- Identify key stakeholders

*Research Note: The importance of clear goals in change implementation is supported by Kotter's (2012) research on leading change.*

[See Goal Review Guide](../guides/goal-review.md)

### 2. Evidence Gathering (15 mins)
**Focus**: Collecting Implementation Data
**Evidence Types**:
- Quantitative metrics
- Qualitative feedback
- Observational data
- Stakeholder input
- Resource utilization

*Research Note: This evidence-based approach aligns with Bryk's (2015) work on improvement science in education.*

[See Evidence Analysis Guide](../guides/evidence-analysis.md)

### 3. Impact Analysis (15 mins)
**Focus**: Evaluating Outcomes
**Key Areas**:
- Student learning impact
- Teaching practice changes
- Resource effectiveness
- Stakeholder responses
- Unintended consequences

*Research Note: The comprehensive analysis approach draws on Earl and Timperley's (2015) research on evaluative thinking.*

### 4. Next Steps Planning (10 mins)
**Focus**: Action Planning
**Decision Areas**:
- Continue/modify/discontinue
- Resource adjustments
- Support needs
- Timeline revisions
- Communication plans

*Research Note: The action planning phase incorporates elements from Hargreaves and Shirley's (2012) work on sustainable educational change.*
