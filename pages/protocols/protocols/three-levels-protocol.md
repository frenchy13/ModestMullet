# Three Levels of Focus Protocol

## Quick Reference
- **Group Size**: Individual (I) or Small Group (SG)
- **Time Required**: 20-25 minutes
- **Focus Areas**: Teaching Practice, Student Engagement, Curriculum, Wellbeing
- **Data Type**: Qualitative
- **Structure**: Highly Structured
- **Purpose**: Issue Identification, Track Progress
- **Template**: [Download Reflection Template](../templates/three-levels-template.md)

## Overview
The Three Levels of Focus protocol helps educators examine their practice through different time-based lenses, encouraging reflection that moves from immediate concerns to longer-term patterns and systemic issues. This approach is grounded in Schön's (1983) concept of reflection-on-action, where practitioners step back to analyze their practice across different timeframes.

## Theoretical Background
This protocol draws on several key theoretical frameworks:
- Schön's (1983) distinction between reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action
- York-Barr et al.'s (2006) framework for reflective practice in education
- Brookfield's (1995) critical reflection lenses
- Timperley's (2015) cycle of professional inquiry

## Materials Needed
- [Reflection Template](../templates/three-levels-template.md)
- Timer
- Relevant evidence or data
- [Evidence Collection Guide](../guides/evidence-collection.md)

## Detailed Process

### 1. Setup (2-3 minutes)
- Choose a specific focus area (e.g., student engagement, assessment practices)
- Gather any relevant evidence or data
- Review the guiding questions for each level
- Set up your reflection space with minimal distractions

*Research Note: The importance of structured preparation for effective reflection is highlighted in Larrivee's (2000) work on developing critical reflection.*

### 2. Surface Level Reflection (5-7 minutes)
**Focus**: Today/This Week
**Guiding Questions**:
- What immediate successes or challenges am I experiencing?
- What patterns am I noticing in my daily practice?
- What quick adjustments could I make tomorrow?
- What's working well right now?

*Research Note: These questions align with Gibbs' (1988) reflective cycle, particularly the description and evaluation phases.*

[See Surface Level Guide for detailed prompts](../guides/surface-level-reflection.md)

### 3. Deeper Level Reflection (5-7 minutes)
**Focus**: This Term
**Guiding Questions**:
- What medium-term trends am I noticing?
- How are my term-long goals progressing?
- What adjustments to my practice might benefit this term's outcomes?
- What resources or support might I need?

*Research Note: This level incorporates elements of Korthagen's (2004) ALACT model of reflection, particularly the awareness of essential aspects phase.*

[See Deeper Level Guide for detailed prompts](../guides/deeper-level-reflection.md)

### 4. Core Level Reflection (5-7 minutes)
**Focus**: This Year/Ongoing Practice
**Guiding Questions**:
- How does my current practice align with my teaching philosophy?
- What long-term changes am I working toward?
- What professional growth areas am I identifying?
- How do my practices align with school/department goals?

*Research Note: This level draws on Kelchtermans' (2009) work on professional self-understanding and career-long reflection.*

### 5. Synthesis (3-5 minutes)
[See Synthesis Guide for detailed process](../guides/synthesis-reflection.md)

## Group Implementation
When used in small groups (2-4 people):
1. Complete individual reflection first
2. Share one insight from each level (2 minutes per person)
3. Identify common themes or challenges
4. Discuss potential collective actions or support needs

*Research Note: The group implementation structure is informed by DuFour's (2004) professional learning community framework.*

## Facilitation Notes
[See Complete Facilitation Guide](../guides/facilitation-tips.md)

### Tips for Success
- Use a timer for each section
- Write continuously during reflection time
- Focus on specific examples rather than generalizations
- Keep evidence or data handy for reference
- Use consistent reflection prompts across sessions

### Common Pitfalls
- Spending too long on immediate concerns
- Failing to identify specific examples
- Not connecting levels to each other
- Skipping the synthesis step
- Making action items too vague
