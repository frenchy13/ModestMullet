# ATLAS Protocol
(Analyzing Teaching & Learning in Action through Systematic observation)

## Quick Reference
- **Group Size**: Small Group (SG, 3-6)
- **Time Required**: 50-55 minutes
- **Focus Areas**: Teaching Practice, Student Learning, Curriculum Implementation
- **Data Type**: Qualitative, Observational
- **Structure**: Highly Structured
- **Purpose**: Analyze Teaching Practice, Generate Solutions
- **Template**: [Download Reflection Template](../templates/atlas-template.md)

## Overview
The ATLAS protocol provides a structured approach for examining teaching and learning through systematic observation and analysis. It focuses on surface features of practice before moving to interpretation, allowing for deep understanding and collaborative learning.

## Theoretical Background
The protocol is grounded in several theoretical frameworks:
- Descriptive Review Process (Carini, 2000)
- Professional Learning Communities (DuFour et al., 2006)
- Lesson Study (Lewis & Hurd, 2011)
- Practice-Based Professional Learning (Ball & Cohen, 1999)
- Situated Learning Theory (Lave & Wenger, 1991)

## Materials Needed
- [ATLAS Template](../templates/atlas-template.md)
- Teaching artifact (lesson plan, video, student work)
- Timer
- [Observation Framework](../guides/observation-framework.md)
- Note-taking materials
- [Evidence Collection Guide](../guides/evidence-collection.md)

## Detailed Process

### 1. Introduction (5 mins)
**Focus**: Setting Context
**Presenter Guidelines**:
- Share teaching context
- Provide background
- State focus question
- Frame the inquiry

*Research Note: The importance of context in professional learning is supported by Timperley's (2011) research on professional conversations.*

[See Context Setting Guide](../guides/context-setting.md)

### 2. Descriptive Round (15 mins)
**Focus**: What do you see?
**Guidelines**:
- Describe only
- No interpretation
- Be specific
- Note details
- Stay objective

*Research Note: This separation of description from interpretation draws on Carini's (2000) work on descriptive review.*

[See Observation Guide](../guides/observation-prompts.md)

### 3. Interpretive Round (15 mins)
**Focus**: What's the meaning?
**Guiding Questions**:
- What does this tell us about teaching?
- What does this tell us about learning?
- What patterns emerge?
- What questions arise?

*Research Note: The interpretive phase aligns with Schön's (1983) work on reflective practice.*

[See Analysis Guide](../guides/success-analysis.md)

### 4. Implications Round (10 mins)
**Focus**: So what/now what?
**Key Areas**:
- Teaching implications
- Learning insights
- Next steps
- Future applications

*Research Note: This action-focused phase draws on Kolb's (1984) experiential learning cycle.*

### 5. Presenter Response (5-10 mins)
**Focus**: Integration and Planning
**Guidelines**:
- Share insights
- Make connections
- Plan actions
- Consider resources

*Research Note: The reflection phase incorporates elements from Dewey's (1933) work on reflective thinking.*

## Group Implementation
[See Group Process Guide](../guides/group-process.md)

### Roles
- Facilitator
- Presenter
- Timekeeper
- Participants

### Size Considerations
- Minimum: 3 participants
- Optimal: 4-6 participants
- Maximum: 8 participants

## Facilitation Notes
[See Complete Facilitation Guide](../guides/facilitation-tips.md)

### Tips for Success
- Maintain protocol structure
- Keep description separate from interpretation
- Encourage specific observations
- Support all voices
- Document insights

### Common Pitfalls
- Rushing to interpretation
- Making assumptions
- Being too general
- Missing details
- Skipping implications

## Variations
[See Protocol Variations Guide](../guides/protocol-variations.md)
- Video Analysis ATLAS
- Student Work ATLAS
