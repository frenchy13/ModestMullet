# Plus/Delta Protocol

## Quick Reference
- **Group Size**: Individual (I), Small Group (SG), or Full Team (FT)
- **Time Required**: 10-15 minutes
- **Focus Areas**: Teaching Practice, Student Engagement, Curriculum, Wellbeing
- **Data Type**: Qualitative
- **Structure**: Flexible
- **Purpose**: Issue Identification, Track Progress
- **Template**: [Download Reflection Template](../templates/plus-delta-template.md)

## Overview
The Plus/Delta protocol is a simple yet powerful tool for rapid reflection and continuous improvement. It focuses on identifying what's working well (Plus) and what needs to change (Delta) in educational practice. This approach provides a balanced perspective, acknowledging successes while planning for improvement.

## Theoretical Background
The Plus/Delta protocol is grounded in several theoretical frameworks:
- Appreciative Inquiry (Cooperrider & Whitney, 2005) - particularly the recognition of strengths
- Growth Mindset (Dweck, 2006) - viewing change as opportunity for improvement
- Single and Double Loop Learning (Argyris, 1977) - examining both outcomes and underlying assumptions
- Continuous Improvement Cycle (Deming, 1986) - regular reflection and adjustment

## Materials Needed
- [Plus/Delta Template](../templates/plus-delta-template.md)
- Sticky notes (if doing group reflection)
- Timer
- [Evidence Collection Guide](../guides/evidence-collection.md)
- Writing materials or digital device

## Detailed Process

### 1. Setup (1-2 minutes)
- Choose specific focus area or keep broad
- Gather any relevant evidence
- Review previous Plus/Delta reflections if available
- Set timer

*Research Note: The importance of regular, structured reflection is supported by Dewey's (1933) work on reflective thinking and practice.*

### 2. Plus Reflection (3-4 minutes)
**Focus**: What's Working Well
**Guiding Questions**:
- What successes have you experienced?
- What strategies are proving effective?
- What positive outcomes are you observing?
- What would you want to continue doing?

*Research Note: This appreciative approach aligns with Seligman's (2011) work on positive psychology in educational settings.*

[See Plus Reflection Guide for detailed prompts](../guides/plus-reflection.md)

### 3. Delta Reflection (3-4 minutes)
**Focus**: What Needs to Change
**Guiding Questions**:
- What challenges are you facing?
- What could be improved?
- What would you do differently next time?
- What support or resources would help?

*Research Note: This improvement focus draws on Hattie's (2012) work on visible learning and the importance of knowing impact.*

### 4. Synthesis (2-3 minutes)
- Identify patterns or themes
- Prioritize changes needed
- Note quick wins vs. longer-term changes
- Plan next steps

*Research Note: This synthesis approach is supported by Kolb's (1984) experiential learning cycle, particularly the abstract conceptualization phase.*

## Group Implementation
When used in groups:
1. Individual reflection first (5-6 minutes)
2. Share Plus items round-robin (2-3 minutes)
3. Share Delta items round-robin (2-3 minutes)
4. Group synthesis and action planning (3-4 minutes)

*Research Note: The group process draws on sociocultural learning theory (Vygotsky, 1978) and professional learning community research (DuFour, 2004).*

### Tips for Success
- Keep focus on specific, observable elements
- Maintain balance between Plus and Delta
- Stay solution-oriented in Delta discussion
- Keep timing tight
- Document for future reference

### Common Pitfalls
- Spending too long on either Plus or Delta
- Being too general
- Focusing only on problems
- Skipping action planning
- Not following up on identified changes

## Variations
[See Protocol Variations Guide](../guides/protocol-variations.md)
- Evidence-Based Plus/Delta
- Student-Focused Plus/Delta
- Program Evaluation Plus/Delta
- Professional Growth Plus/Delta
