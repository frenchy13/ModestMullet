# Success Analysis Protocol

## Quick Reference
- **Group Size**: Small Group (SG, 2-4 people)
- **Time Required**: 25-30 minutes
- **Focus Areas**: Teaching Practice, Student Engagement, Curriculum, Wellbeing
- **Data Type**: Qualitative, Observational
- **Structure**: Flexible
- **Purpose**: Generate Solutions, Track Progress
- **Template**: [Download Reflection Template](../templates/success-analysis-template.md)

## Overview
The Success Analysis Protocol helps educators identify, analyze, and replicate successful practices. By focusing on what works well, participants can better understand the factors contributing to success and apply these insights to other situations. This appreciative approach builds confidence while developing practical strategies for improvement.

## Theoretical Background
The protocol is grounded in several theoretical frameworks:
- Appreciative Inquiry (Cooperrider & Srivastva, 1987)
- Positive Psychology in Education (Seligman et al., 2009)
- Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977)
- Professional Capital (Hargreaves & Fullan, 2012)
- Solution-Focused Brief Therapy principles adapted for education (Murphy, 2015)

## Detailed Process

### 1. Individual Writing (5-7 minutes)
**Focus**: Documenting a Success Story
**Guiding Questions**:
- What specific success have you experienced recently?
- What made it successful?
- What was your role in the success?
- What evidence shows this was successful?

*Research Note: The importance of narrative in professional learning is supported by Clandinin and Connelly's (2000) work on teacher knowledge and narrative inquiry.*

[See Success Story Guide for prompts](../guides/success-story-guide.md)

### 2. Small Group Sharing (3-4 minutes per person)
**Focus**: Presenting Success Stories
**Guidelines**:
- Share complete story
- Include context
- Describe specific actions
- Note outcomes

*Research Note: The sharing phase draws on Lave and Wenger's (1991) concepts of communities of practice and situated learning.*

### 3. Group Analysis (5-7 minutes)
**Focus**: Identifying Success Factors
**Guiding Questions**:
- What common elements emerge?
- What specific strategies worked?
- What conditions supported success?
- What resources were crucial?

*Research Note: This analytical approach aligns with Bryk's (2015) work on improvement science in education.*

[See Analysis Guide for detailed process](../guides/success-analysis.md)

### 4. Application Planning (5 minutes)
**Focus**: Transferring Insights
**Key Areas**:
- Identify transferable elements
- Plan specific applications
- Consider required resources
- Anticipate challenges

*Research Note: The transfer of learning principles is based on Perkins and Salomon's (2012) research on transfer and adaptation.*

## Group Implementation
[See Group Process Guide](../guides/group-process-guide.md)

### Optimal Conditions
- Small groups (2-4 people)
- Mixed experience levels
- Similar context helpful
- Regular meeting schedule

### Role Rotation
