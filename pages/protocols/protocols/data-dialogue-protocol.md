# Data Dialogue Protocol

## Quick Reference
- **Group Size**: Small Group (SG) or Full Team (FT)
- **Time Required**: 30-40 minutes
- **Focus Areas**: Teaching Practice, Student Engagement, Curriculum, Assessment
- **Data Type**: Qualitative, Quantitative, Observational
- **Structure**: Highly Structured
- **Purpose**: Issue Identification, Track Progress, Generate Solutions
- **Template**: [Download Reflection Template](../templates/data-dialogue-template.md)

## Overview
The Data Dialogue Protocol provides a structured approach for collaborative examination of student data, assessment results, or other educational evidence. It separates observation from interpretation, allowing educators to build shared understanding before moving to analysis and action planning.

## Theoretical Background
The protocol draws on several theoretical frameworks:
- Data-Driven Decision Making (Mandinach & Jackson, 2012)
- Collaborative Inquiry (Earl & Timperley, 2009)
- Evidence-Based Practice in Education (Hargreaves, 1999)
- Professional Learning Communities (DuFour & Eaker, 1998)
- Assessment for Learning (Black & Wiliam, 1998)

## Materials Needed
- [Data Dialogue Template](../templates/data-dialogue-template.md)
- Relevant data sets or evidence
- Timer
- [Data Organization Guide](../guides/data-organization-guide.md)
- Chart paper or digital display
- [Data Visualization Guide](../guides/data-visualization-guide.md)

## Detailed Process

### 1. Preparation (5 minutes)
- Organize data for presentation
- Set up visual displays
- Review protocol steps
- Assign facilitator and timekeeper roles

*Research Note: The importance of data organization and preparation is supported by Bernhardt's (2013) work on data analysis for school improvement.*

### 2. Data Presentation (5 minutes)
**Focus**: Sharing data without interpretation
**Guidelines**:
- Present facts only
- Use clear visuals
- Avoid conclusions
- Share context as needed

*Research Note: This separation of observation from interpretation is grounded in Sch√∂n's (1983) work on reflective practice.*

[See Data Presentation Guide for detailed steps](../guides/data-presentation-guide.md)

### 3. Clarifying Questions (5 minutes)
**Focus**: Understanding the data
**Guidelines**:
- Ask factual questions only
- Seek to understand context
- No interpretation yet
- Focus on missing information

*Research Note: The clarifying phase draws on Timperley's (2011) research on professional conversations and evidence-based discussions.*

### 4. Observations (10 minutes)
**Focus**: What do you notice?
**Guiding Questions**:
- What patterns do you see?
- What stands out?
- What surprises you?
- What's missing?

*Research Note: This structured observation process aligns with Love's (2009) work on using data to improve learning.*

[See Observation Guide for prompts](../guides/observation-prompts.md)

### 5. Interpretation (10 minutes)
**Focus**: Making meaning of the data
**Guiding Questions**:
- What does this tell us?
- What factors might explain what we see?
- What assumptions are we making?
- What additional data might we need?

*Research Note: The interpretation phase incorporates elements from Earl's (2003) work on assessment as learning.*

### 6. Implications (5 minutes)
- Identify action items
- Plan next steps
- Determine additional data needs
- Schedule follow-up

*Research Note: This action-planning phase draws on Katz and Dack's (2013) research on professional learning and improvement.*

## Group Implementation
[See Group Process Guide](../guides/group-process-guide.md)

### Roles
- Facilitator: Guides process, maintains focus
- Timekeeper: Monitors phases
- Presenter: Shares data
- Recorder: Documents insights
- Participants: Engage in dialogue

### Size Considerations
- Small Groups (3-8): All participate in all phases
- Larger Groups (9+): Consider breakout discussions
- Full Team: May need extended timeframes

## Facilitation Notes
[See Complete Facilitation Guide](../guides/facilitation-tips.md)

### Tips for Success
- Maintain strict timing
- Keep focus on evidence
- Encourage all voices
- Document key insights
- Follow protocol structure

### Common Pitfalls
- Jumping to conclusions
- Mixing observation and interpretation
- Allowing dominant voices
- Skipping clarifying questions
- Not documenting actions

## Variations
[See Protocol Variations Guide](../guides/protocol-variations-guides.md)
- Student Achievement Data Dialogue
- Behavioral Data Analysis
- Program Evaluation Review
