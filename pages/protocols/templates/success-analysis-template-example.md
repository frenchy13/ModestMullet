# Success Analysis Template

## Session Information
Date: October 15, 2024
Participants: Math Department Team (Sarah, Michael, James)
Time Allocated: 25-30 minutes
Focus Area: Student Engagement in Problem-Solving

## Individual Success Story (5-7 minutes)

### Success Description
Title: "Gallery Walk Problem-Solving Success"
Date/Period: September 20-30, 2024
Context: Year 10 Advanced Mathematics Class

### Detailed Account
What happened?
Implemented a new gallery walk approach to problem-solving where students worked in groups to solve complex problems posted around the room. Each group started at different problems, solved them, and then rotated to review and build upon other groups' solutions. The engagement level was exceptional, and the quality of mathematical discussions surpassed previous approaches.

### Key Actions Taken
1. Created carefully sequenced problem sets
2. Established clear rotation and documentation procedures
3. Implemented structured peer feedback process

### Evidence of Success
1. 100% student participation rate
2. Increased quality of written explanations
3. Positive student feedback surveys

### Contributing Factors
Personal Actions:
- Thorough preparation of materials
- Clear instruction of process
- Strategic group formation

External Support:
- Department planning time
- Colleague observation feedback
- Student input on process

Resources Used:
- Large format paper for solutions
- Structured feedback forms
- Timer system

## Group Sharing Notes (3-4 minutes per person)
