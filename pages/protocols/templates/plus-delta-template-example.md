# Plus/Delta Reflection Template

## Session Information
Date: October 15, 2024
Participant(s): Jane Smith, Teaching Team
Focus Area: Student Engagement in Year 10 Mathematics
Time Allocated: 15 minutes

## Pre-Reflection Setup
### Context
Current Goals/Objectives: Improve student engagement in problem-solving tasks
Specific Focus: Group work dynamics in complex problems
Evidence/Data Available: Last week's student work samples, observation notes

### Materials Needed
[x] Previous Plus/Delta reflections (September review)
[x] Relevant evidence or data
[x] Timer
[x] Note-taking materials

## Plus Reflection (3-4 minutes)
*What's working well?*

### Successes Observed
1. Students are more willing to attempt challenging problems
2. Peer support has increased during group work
3. More students sharing solutions with the class

### Effective Strategies
1. Using real-world examples in problem sets
2. Mixed-ability grouping structure
3. "No hands up" discussion technique

### Positive Outcomes
1. Increased participation from previously quiet students
2. Better quality mathematical discussions
3. More students completing homework tasks

### Elements to Continue
1. Starting each lesson with an engaging problem
2. Regular group role rotation
3. End-of-lesson reflection time

## Delta Reflection (3-4 minutes)
*What needs to change?*

### Current Challenges
1. Some groups still dominated by one or two students
2. Time management in problem-solving sessions
3. Engaging students who finish early

### Areas for Improvement
1. More structured roles in group work
2. Clearer time signals during activities
3. Extension task system

### Different Approaches to Try
1. Use task cards for group roles
2. Implement visual timer display
3. Create problem-solving extension bank

### Support/Resources Needed
1. Additional problem-solving resources
2. Timer display system
3. Professional learning on group dynamics

## Synthesis (2-3 minutes)

### Key Patterns/Themes
Plus Patterns:
- Group work generally improving engagement
- Real-world connections are effective

Delta Patterns:
- Time management needs attention
- Group dynamics need more structure

### Priority Actions
Quick Wins:
1. Create and implement role cards for next lesson
2. Set up classroom timer display

Longer-term Changes:
1. Develop bank of extension problems
2. Research professional learning opportunities

## Follow-up Planning

### Action Items
| Action | Timeline | Resources Needed | Person Responsible |
|--------|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Create role cards | This week | Card template, laminator | Jane |
| Set up timer | Tomorrow | Digital display | IT Support |

### Next Steps
Next Review Date: October 29, 2024
Success Indicators: More balanced group participation, better time management
Check-in Points: Daily quick reflection, weekly team check-in

### Additional Notes
Consider surveying students about group work preferences
Look into digital tools for managing group roles
