title: Space Marine Armour Variants
subtitle: When you want it simple with pictures
---
The purpose of this page is to give a **quick** breakdown on the different Tactical Space Marine armour variants. This is by no means exhaustive and doesn't cover any subvariants or legion/chapter variants. What it will do though is allow you to quickly identify key features on basic GW models and their similarities and differences.

Most of the information below can be found [Here](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2016/10/27/power-armour-through-the-ages/) (minus my underlining of key features and additional notes on appearance) which is a history on the model design of space marines by Games Workshop and the order the sculpts were actually created.
